And that’s not even counting the potential for policy headlines from Washington, which played a big role in trading last week.
This morning, trading seems pretty subdued ahead of the big week. That’s probably to be expected as Wall Street tends to look to earnings for a snapshot of the recent past and guidance for future performance. About a third of S&P 500 Index (SPX) companies are set to open their books this week.
Investors probably want to hear more about Biden’s potential capital gains tax hike on high earners, news of which contributed to last week’s price volatility.
There’s good news on the vaccine front as the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) jab is back in distribution in many U.S. states after health officials lifted an 11-day pause on use of the vaccine amid worries about blood clotting as a rare side effect. 
With so much to consider this week, you might want to keep an eye on Wall Street’s main measure of investor jitters, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). The index is up this morning, but it’s hanging out at just under 18. A number below 20 in this market appears to mean alarm bells aren’t really much of an issue. But there could be plenty of room for surprises this week amid so many earnings reports, a Fed meeting, and lots of economic reports.
The Week Ahead In Economic Data
This morning, we saw durable goods orders for March come in softer than expected—up 0.5% against a Briefing.com consensus forecast of a 2.0% gain. The numbers come after durable goods orders in February unexpectedly fell after a string of gains. A month ago, some economy-watchers suggested the soft February number could have been an anomaly—a nonlinear data point within an uptrend. This month’s tepid number might call into question the pace of the current recovery. Still, it was a positive number, and considering how atypical this pandemic period has been, the recovery is likely to be atypical as well.  
Tomorrow, the market is scheduled to get two February price indices for the housing market and a consumer confidence number for April from the Conference Board. Last time around, the index for March showed consumer confidence at its highest point in a year amid recovery expectations. With the vaccine rollout progressing well, in the United States at least, it could be interesting to see whether the numbers show another jump.

2021-04-26 21:26:49+00:00,Can Apple's Earnings Impress Again? Tough Act To Follow For iPhone Maker In Fiscal Q2,"There’s so much news swirling around Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) that digging into the fundamentals seems like a monumental task. We’ll do it anyway as investors await earnings from the biggest company (in market cap) on earth.
The iPhone maker’s earnings report after the close Wednesday will come right after it unveiled a bunch of new products just a week ago, and following a solid fiscal Q1 for the iPhone maker. 
If you’re keeping score, AAPL has a hard act to follow. In its fiscal Q1, it surpassed analysts’ estimates in almost every key category, whether it was iPhone sales, services, iPads, Macs, or wearables. Greater China sales rose 57%. Can AAPL hit it out of the park again? That’s what investors are wondering.
Going into earnings, consider keeping an eye on Services revenues—the category that includes cloud storage and backup, digital content and payment services. It’s grown so quickly that it’s elbowed its way up to the No. 2 business category spot for the company. The question is whether Services can keep up the strong traction it’s developed over the last few quarters.
Mac and iPad sales, too, might be a couple to keep tabs on, as many analysts have pointed out how the pandemic seemed to infuse new life into the lowly personal computer. AAPL’s rollout of new products last week (see more below) could be a harbinger of what’s ahead.
On the subject of “what’s ahead,” it’s something investors have had to basically guess the last few quarters. AAPL hasn’t offered guidance since the pandemic began. Will that change now that vaccinations are making progress? We’ll have to wait and see.
iPhone Impressed Last Time, But Keep An Eye On Supply Chain
One thing that could be tough for AAPL this time around is exceeding iPhone expectations. It’s not too long since people were talking about the iPhone being a smaller and smaller share of AAPL’s total revenue. Then AAPL sold a record-breaking $65.6 billion worth of iPhones in fiscal Q1, a 17% year-over-year rise. Those results were helped by the introduction of new 5G models last fall.
AAPL faced some supply chain issues in fiscal Q2, and investors should also listen for any updates on those. However, it doesn’t look like anything AAPL couldn’t handle, according to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani.
Barron’s quoted Daryanani saying that AAPL is “well-positioned to report upside to March quarter estimates,” driven by strong performance by both iPhone and services, and despite ongoing component shortages.
“While the supply chain issues are real, we expect Apple will be relatively protected by its status as one of the largest electronics purchasers in the world,” the analyst wrote in a recent report. He points out that Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, has called out the tight supply of parts but said it would affect less than 10% of customer orders.
He notes that Apple had guided to some deceleration in services in the quarter after 30% growth in the December quarter, but he sees potential that the growth will be steady or better given strength in the App Store.

2021-04-29 14:05:34+00:00,"With Fed Meeting Out Of Way, Market Eyes Amazon, Facebook Earnings Due Later","Mark Twain once quipped, “Everyone complains about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it.” 
Well, these days everyone probably would complain about inflation if it ever reappeared in a major way, but the Fed promises it won’t do anything about it until employment is on track toward whatever “normal” was before the pandemic. 
As Wall Street analysts expected, the Fed didn’t change rates or make any other policy changes coming out of this week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that ended this afternoon. Rates stayed near zero, where they’ve been for over a year, and the Fed remains committed to its $120 billion a month bond-buying program designed to keep borrowing costs low and refuel the economy coming out of the pandemic. 
At first blush, this looks like a pretty dovish meeting, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made clear the Fed isn’t talking about any decline in asset purchases or increase in rates. There were three things investors were curious about going in—asset purchases, rates, and inflation—and Powell was dovish on all of them. 
Treasury yields actually began to fall as the Powell press conference went on this afternoon, with the 10-year yield edging down toward 1.61% to 1.62%. That’s down a few basis points from this morning’s two-week highs. 
There was no change to the Fed’s commitment, outlined last month, to basically stand on the sidelines “for some time” if year-over-year inflation stays “moderately” above what has been the Fed’s long-term goal of 2%. Core inflation, per the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices report, was 1.4% in February, the most recent month tracked. However, consumer prices are already rising more than 2% on a year-over-year basis. 
Optimism Club: Fed Sees Positive Signs For Economy
There were a couple of changes in the Fed’s statement from last time, with the Fed now saying employment has “strengthened.” Arguably, you could see that as an improvement from “turned up” in its March statement. The statement noted some inflation, but again said it’s likely to be “transitory.” March consumer prices rose 2.6%, the highest year-over-increase since August 2018. 
In another change, the Fed’s statement now says sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak, but have “shown improvement.” The public health crisis still weighs on the economy, the Fed said, but no longer on employment or inflation. 
Still, inflation doesn’t seem to be a really big concern now for the Fed, judging from how the statement and press conference went. They seem basically comfortable with inflation staying above 2% for the rest of the year because that will be against very easy comparisons to a year ago, when we had the big slowdown due to Covid. The Fed apparently believes we’ll have to wait until next year to get a reliable sense of what inflation is doing 
The stock market had been mixed earlier Wednesday and stayed that way after the Fed’s decision and as investors waited for Powell to start his press conference. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) actually made up some ground and turned green after the statement. Earnings continue to be solid but the SPX hadn’t really gone anywhere since earnings season started, possibly an indication that a lot of the strength in earnings was already built in. 
Basically, this meeting looks like a placeholder. That means attention could focus more on the big earnings reports from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) coming up later today, along with the gross domestic product (GDP) report and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) earnings due tomorrow. 
One thing Powell isn’t ready to do is chip around the edges of the Fed’s program to support the economy.

In light of the momentous occasion, Benzinga spoke with MindMed co-founder and CEO J.R. Rahn, as well as board member Kevin O’Leary, author, investor, ""Shark Tank"" star and co-founder of O'Shares ETFs.
What To Know: Mental health doesn’t discriminate. That’s become apparent given the pandemic which devastated the economy and left millions unemployed. With traditional mental health care infrastructures in the U.S. being outdated, demand for new, alternative solutions — those without acute adverse effects such as abuse and dependence — has picked up.
MindMed, which is focused on the medicinal value of psychedelics, is believed to have the answer by many, including Kevin O’Leary who backed the company in its early stages.
“I’ve been involved with the company for almost three years,” O’Leary explained. “When I first heard of this idea from J.R., I thought he was nuts. But, he convinced me and he has been 100% right in every milestone of the journey.”
Dubbed the ""Tesla of mental health,"" MindMed, through proprietary research, some of which was conducted in collaboration with the laboratory of Professor Dr. Matthias Liechti, the world’s leading psychedelics, pharmacology and clinical research group at University Hospital Basel, in Switzerland, has helped destigmatize and deploy psychedelics solutions.

No longer is going to a physical store and browsing the aisles the only method of shopping. More browsing than ever is taking place online, more sales than ever are occurring in digital spaces and more pressure on retailers is driving change – and new challenges – that continue to alter the shopping experience.

Understanding these changes are key to creating successful customer journeys. More importantly, though, is understanding what the modern consumer seeks. A series of recent reports provide some insights into the consumer of 2021 and what they say is important to them, giving retailers and brands a road map to fulfilling consumer needs.

The Face Of The Online Consumer

In Jungle Scout's Q1 2021 Consumer Trends Report, consumers reported that free shipping was the top reason to shop online. That jumped up from the fourth spot in the Q4 report, suggesting shipping cost was less of a factor during the busy holiday season. Lower prices, which was sixth in the Q4 report, jumped up to No. 2 in Q1. Convenience was third in Q1 after topping the survey in Q4.

The report, which surveyed 1,005 U.S. consumers Jan. 26-29, 2021, found that 46% of consumers leave items in their online cart and forget about them, suggesting brands have some work to do to convert these customers.

When it comes to which online retailers are most popular, it's no surprise that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) topped the list, with 73% of respondents saying they shopped at Amazon.com at least once in the past three months. Amazon was followed by Walmart (NYSE: WMT) at 40%; eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Target (NYSE: TGT), 18% each; and Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), 10% each.

When it comes to returns, 31% of respondents said they would return a product bought from an online store. That number increased slightly, to 32% for Amazon shoppers, but both numbers remained below the 37% who said they were likely to return an item at a physical store.

Consumers looking for items often start with Amazon, with 74% of them saying that is their first online stop. Search engines were popular as well, with 65% saying that's where they start researching items. A brand or retailer's website was cited by 38% followed by social networks Facebook, 31%; YouTube, 29%; Instagram, 21%; and TikTok, 10%. (Note: Respondents could select multiple answers.)
